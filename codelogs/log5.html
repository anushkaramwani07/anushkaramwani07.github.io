  <h3>Presenting an image using HTML tag vs presenting an image as a background?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>While using html tag it will set that image as an element on the page and it has its own height and width automatically</li>
    <li>It will move with the page as you scroll.</li>
    <li>If we use it as css background, it doesn't show by itself, its just in the background.</li>
    <li>The image doesnt haev its own size, it fills whatever space the box has.</li>
    <li>img tag have alt text that is useful for readers</li>
    <li>background-img is decorative so it odes not have any alt texts.</li>
    <li>With css background you can add effects like repeat, cover or set position.</li>
    <li>The img tag just place sthe pictures, it doesn't control the behaviour.</li>
  </ul>
