        <li>Max-width: Means "apply these styles if the screen is smaller than certain width". It is usually used to switch into a mobile layout.</li>
        <li>Min- width: Means "apply these styles if the screen is larger than a certain width". It's useful for adding layouts that work better on desktops.</li>
