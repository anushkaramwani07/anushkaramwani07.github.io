  <h3>Presenting an image using HTML tag vs presenting an image as a background?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>While using html tag it will set that image as an element on the page and it has its own height and width
      automatically</li>
    <li>It will move with the page as you scroll.</li>
    <li>If we use it as css background, it doesn't show by itself, its just in the background.</li>
    <li>The image doesnt have its own size, it fills whatever space the box has.</li>
    <li>img tag have alt text that is useful for readers.</li>
    <li>background-img is decorative so it odes not have any alt texts.</li>
    <li>With css background you can add effects like repeat, cover or set position.</li>
    <li>The img tag just places the pictures, it doesn't control the behaviour.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Other CSS properties that affect the display of background images</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>background-image:</b> sets one or more image to background. </li>
    <li><b>background-repeat:</b>It defines how the background image repeats. Example, "repeat" will repeatboth
      horizontally and vertically. "no repeat" will have no repition.</li>
    <li><b>background-position:</b>Controls the background image is placed inside the element.</li>
    <li><b>background-size:</b>Sets how large the background image should be.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Difference between dimentions and resolution in bitmap image</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Dimention refers to the image's physical size in pixel(height X width), while resolution describes how densely
      those pixels are packed(pixels per inch or PPI), affecting print quality but not on-screen size.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>What are the similarities and differences between these image file formats? Why are some better than others for
    specific uses? </h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Similarities: </b>All images file formats are used on the web. ALl can display visual browsers adn design tools.</li>
    <li><b>GIF:</b>great for short animation</li>
    <li><b>PNG: </b>best for images needing transperency.</li>
  </ul>
