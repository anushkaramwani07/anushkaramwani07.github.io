    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>At Atlas Cafe, we believe coffee is more than a drink, it's a lifestyle. Founded in 2015 by two friends who couldn't agree on the best way to make a latte, our cafe quickly became a haven for caffeine lovers, bookworms, and anyone who just really likes pastries.
        Our mission is simple: serve delicious coffee, tasty snacks, and a little bit of joy in every cup. Whether you're here for a morning pick-me-up, a mid-afternoon break, or just to escape your roommate's questionable music playlist, we've got your back.
        We take pride in using fresh ingredients, ethically-sourced beans, and a touch of magic (okay, maybe it's just extra whipped cream). Come for the coffee, stay for the cozy vibes, and maybe the occasional dad joke from our baristas.
